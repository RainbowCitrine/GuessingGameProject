- Hi there! So, I had wanted to practice more GUI in C++ and luckily my Professor had assigned us a GUI assignment where we had to hardcode a guessing game on our own. She gave us a couple of tutorials on how the GUI works which was very helpful for us to code our guessing game by ourselves. In my program I developed the logic like any normal guessing game and I wanted to included colorful borders and so I used pink and purple for the prompts, while red and blue will alert the user if they are hot or cold.
